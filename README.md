# Resources

To perform this task I used the following activities as a reference: plotting_groups_solution, Average_state_rain_solution, pie_chart_solution, bar_chart_solution, samples_solution (for boxplot), regression_solution, and of course I used de example that was provided in the forlder called "pymaceuticals_starter_EXAMPLE.". I also got help from my classmates in the study groups and videos from yuotube.com:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpMhMUcmLJw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpMhMUcmLJw)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpMhMUcmLJw, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE8CVGJuftI, and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKUD-F3vK44.
